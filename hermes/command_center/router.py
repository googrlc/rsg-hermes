"""Intake router — fan a synthesized submission out three ways (Phase 2).

Given a ``SubmissionObject`` (deterministic extract + top-model synthesis have run),
decide where each piece belongs:

- **CRM** ← sales only: one opportunity per line of business, so each can be worked.
- **AMS** (NowCerts) ← the structured rest: the insured/prospect identity + the
  incumbent policy. A *create* path, distinct from the case/task *relay*.
- **PDF** ← the remainder: schedules, loss history, coverage narrative — things that
  live on the source document as evidence, never force-fit into fields.

``plan_routing`` is pure (no writes) — it produces the approval artifact. ``stage_routing``
enqueues the plan as gated ``outbound_sync_queue`` intents (additive, human-approved,
nothing writes synchronously); a downstream executor drains them to CRM / NowCerts.
