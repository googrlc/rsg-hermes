"""Command Center dashboard reads — KPIs, approval queue, activity feed.

Wired to live data where it's cheap and honest:
  - KPIs from the canonical book (canonical_clients / canonical_policies) + the
    latest agency snapshot for retention.
  - Approval queue from cc_submissions still in review (Phase 1 output).
  - Feed from cc_review_events (the real intake activity).

Pipeline stays None: the Supabase `opportunities` rollup for this card is not
wired yet (`opportunity_summary` below serves the LOB view). We show
real premium/clients, not a placeholder, and compare retention to RSG's standing
75% target (the book was 54.92%) rather than an invented goal.
