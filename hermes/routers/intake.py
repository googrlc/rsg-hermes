"""Intake — lead capture and the intake desk.

Leads and their notes/conversion, the intake queue and its executor, pipeline
stages, and the agency-intake draft/approve pair.

This is NOT the same intake as rsg-cptintake. That repo is the NowCerts
submission gateway (rsg-intake-gate) — an MCP/AMS relay with its own operator
UI, owning /api/intakes/* and /api/intake/documents. This router is the
CRM-side desk: who came in, what they need, and where the deal sits.

The two are one character apart on the wire — /api/intakes (gateway) versus
/api/intake (here) — and the portal proxies them to different backends on that
distinction alone. Anyone consolidating the two should fix the naming before
the routing, not after.
