"""Commit an approved new-business intake — Supabase pipeline, CRM-only by default.

On approval this:
  1. Creates the Supabase ``opportunities`` rows (the pipeline — immediate, no AMS write).
  2. Creates the client's Nextcloud folder tree (if configured).
  3. Only when ``HERMES_INTAKE_STAGES_AMS_INSURED=1``: stages a NowCerts
     ``create_insured`` (prospect) job on ``outbound_sync_queue``.

Step 3 is OFF by default, and that default is the agency's rule rather than a
matter of caution:

    The CRM is the working copy; NowCerts is the record of what is REAL.

An intake is a prospect. A prospect is not a record of insurance, and a book
filled with prospects who never bought is a book that means nothing — the same
reasoning that put the lead station in ``crm_leads`` instead of the AMS. The
insured reaches NowCerts when a deal on it is WON, which is what the won-push
executor does with ``opportunities.policy_number``.

The staging path is kept, not deleted, because there are real cases for it (a
migration, a backfill, an account that genuinely exists already). It just has to
be asked for. Nothing here has ever written to NowCerts synchronously.
