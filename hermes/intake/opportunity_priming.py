"""Prime a freshly created opportunity from NowCerts — the fast AMS pull-back.

When an opportunity is created (intake commit, or the cockpit "+ New" button) we
don't want to wait for the ~5-min executor scheduler to tie it to the AMS. This
does the pull promptly so the pipeline row lands already linked and fleshed out:

  * If the opportunity is already linked (``insured_id`` set), nothing to do.
  * Else look up an existing NowCerts insured by name / FEIN. On a match, link its
    GUID and pull the segment fields (prospect_type, insured_type, lead_source)
    onto the pipeline row — only where the row doesn't already have a value.
  * Else (no existing insured) optionally kick the intake executor once, so a
    queued + approved ``create_insured`` job runs now instead of next cycle.

One AMS lookup serves a whole client's line-of-business rows. Best-effort by
design: every failure is swallowed and logged — priming must never break
opportunity creation. Disable with ``HERMES_OPPORTUNITY_PRIMING=0``.
