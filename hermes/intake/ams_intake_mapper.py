"""Intake → NowCerts insured write, with read-back verification (P4).

Turns a locked ``SubmissionObject`` into a NowCerts ``create_insured`` payload and
**proves the write landed** by reading the record back and comparing field-by-field.
The mapping is data-driven from ``ams_field_map.yaml`` — the one place that decides
which fields have an AMS home — so "correct into the AMS" has a single definition.

Contract (mirrors ``ams/writeback.py`` for corrections, adapted to a create):

    build payload (verified fields only)
      → duplicate search
      → create_insured
      → read back by the new GUID
      → verify field-by-field
      → receipt: VERIFIED | COMMITTED_UNVERIFIED | DUPLICATE_FOUND

Safety rules, unchanged from the writeback path:
- **Verified fields only reach the AMS.** A field whose NowCerts key is not yet
  confirmed (``verified: false``) is surfaced in ``unsupported_fields`` — staged
  and visible, never written, never counted as landed.
- **Read-back is the receipt.** A create that returns 200 but does not read back
  matching is ``COMMITTED_UNVERIFIED``, not success.
- I/O is injected (``create_fn`` / ``read_fn`` / ``dup_search_fn``) so the core is
  testable without the live AMS.
