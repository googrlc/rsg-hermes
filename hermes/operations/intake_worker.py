"""intake_submissions worker — drives the rsg-intake state machine.

Pipeline per row (PROJECT-CONTEXT.md):

  received → synthesizing → synthesized → drafting → awaiting_approval
                                                              ↓ (Slack APPROVE)
                                                            approved
                                                              ↓
                                                            writing → written → complete

  Any state → failed (with error_log entry + Slack alert)

This file lands incrementally across Phase 3:

  Step 2 (here): worker scaffold + ``received -> awaiting_approval`` arc.
                 Synthesizer + Slack draft post are stubbed; the arc
                 transitions states so the claim pattern is exercised
                 end-to-end. Stubs raise NotImplementedError which the
                 worker catches and routes to ``failed`` + Slack alert.
  Step 3:        actual synthesizer fill-in (commands/agency_intake.py).
  Step 4:        Slack draft post replaces the stubbed _post_draft.
  Step 5:        ``approved -> writing -> written -> complete`` arc +
                 retrieval inserts + completion post.

Single-worker assumption is fine today; the claim pattern in
``claim_next_received`` makes scale-out safe later.
