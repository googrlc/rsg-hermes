"""ACORD checkbox questions — classify, scope, and gate (P3).

The 125/126 template carries 208 checkbox fields whose tooltips are the questions
(``docs/acord/field-catalogs/acord_125_126.questions.json``). This module answers:

  1. Which boxes does a human have to answer? (classification)
  2. Which of those are in scope for the lines being marketed? (scope)
  3. Is the submission allowed to stage to Supabase / the AMS yet? (gate)

Classification — three classes:
  structural     set by what the agent selected (LOB boxes, attachments, status,
                 legal entity, billing) — not prompted.
  derived        set deterministically from the record (business type, owner/tenant,
                 occurrence-vs-claims-made, phone type, interest type) — not prompted.
  agent_question everything else — a genuine underwriting Y/N the agent must answer.

The default is **agent_question**: a box is prompted unless it clearly matches a
structural/derived pattern. That bias is deliberate — "all the Y/N boxes should be
prompted before Supabase → AMS" — so a new/unrecognized box errs toward being asked,
never silently skipped.

Gate: a submission cannot stage while any **in-scope agent_question** is unanswered.
In scope = a base question, or one belonging to a line the agent selected (GL
questions only gate when GL is being marketed).
